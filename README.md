Building AI course project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Development of an AI driven text creation for brand management systems and creating on brand content.

## Background

Today, many leading brands use brand platforms to make brand management easier and as efficient as possible. In addition to the most improntant brand guidelines, several systems are already providing layout generator based on AI methods to enable all employees to creat on brand designs. They definetley change the way a brand design can be implemented in the near future. Bute we have to concider: a good brand is not just about good design. It's the purpose and the story a company stands for. The challenge for good marketers remains how good they translate the values, goals and ambitions into good communication. Automated text creation is not yet widespread and is still in its infancy, but is already used by some companies. So when it comes to emotional and strongly humanistic content, even the most modern AI prototypes run into problems. Is it possible to develop an AI technique which creates headline and copy texts based on the brands purpose?

The topic is exciting because, on the one hand, it allows all employees, not just those with an affinity for marketing, to create on brand media, and on the other hand, more time and money are available to concentrate on highly strategic important topics. It should play an important role for all brands, especially because nowadays you have to distribute the right messages to all channels in the shortest possible time.

## How is it used?

Wherever writing and creating informative texts are required, AI opens up new opportunities for automating content creation. It's mostyl in the field of normal text developing as for ads, social media posts and so on. Therefore, a method would help every normal employee, who is not familiar with marketing and creative writing. And it enables brand teams to manage their implementation mor efficently. 


## Data sources and AI methods

The AI method has to be trained with the data like brand purpose, values, goals and so, which will be created by people. 

## Challenges

As in the actual time AI can't replace the creativity from people it's still true that promotional and conceotual texts that are supposed to achieve high conversion rates are better written by real people. As well, AI methods can't  predict current issues such as catastrophes, political issues and so on and therefore cannot follow them while text creation. 

## What next?

Such an idea can best be implemented on the basis of a real case. Therefore it would be grate to have both, a partner as best practice example as well as people who have already dealt with the automated creation of text. Whereas as part of an agency i have a lot of experience with brands and their use of brand management systems.
